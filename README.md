#### The reason behind this IOS music player app

I do have lots of songs in my  collection , consisting of hundreds of singers, composers, playlists and lyricists. There are hundreds of songs in each of the categories  & groups  (say playlist or singer) . I do have the habit of playing songs from one group (say playlist names “malayalam-2000” ) , stop playing that playlist after listening to a few songs and  switch to another group (say playlist names “malayalam-1990”).  Later I would like to stop playing playlist “malayalam-1990” and go back to playlist “malayalam-2000” . The problem I face during this return activity is that either I have to start playing from the first song in the playlist “malayalam-2000” or I have to remember where I left previously on the playlist “malayalam-2000”.
